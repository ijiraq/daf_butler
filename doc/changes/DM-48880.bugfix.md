Fix a query bug that could lead to unexpectedly coarse spatial joins.

When dataset search or other join operand had some dimensions from either side of a potential spatial join (e.g. `{tract, visit}`), we had been blocking the addition of an automatic spatial join on the assumption that this would be embedded in that join operand.
But this is only desirable when the spatial join that would have been added actually the same one implied by that join operand's dimensions; if it's something more fine grained (e.g. `{tract, patch, visit}`) we end up with result rows that relate dimensions (e.g. `patch` and `visit`) that do not actually overlap.
Now automatic spatial joins are only blocked when the join operand includes all dimensions that would have participated in the automatic join.
