Modified the Obscore ``RecordFactory`` to support per-universe subclass discovery using entry points.

* Added ``RecordFactory.get_record_type_from_universe`` to obtain the correct factory class.
* Renamed ``ExposureRegionFactory`` to ``DerivedRegionFactory`` to make it clearer that this class is not solely used for exposures but the usage can change with universe.
* Added ``RecordFactory.region_dimension`` to return the dimension that would be needed to obtain a region for this universe.
