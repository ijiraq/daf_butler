* Added new class ``DatasetProvenance`` for tracking the provenance of an individual dataset.
* Modified ``Butler.put()`` to accept an optional ``DatasetProvenance``.
* Added ``add_provenance`` methods to ``FormatterV2`` and ``StorageClassDelegate``.
  These methods will now be called with the provenance object during ``Butler.put()`` to allow the in-memory dataset to be updated prior to writing.
