The `Query` class now has a `join_data_coordinate_table` method for uploading data IDs from astropy tables.  This includes support for filling in required-dimension columns using constraints from a `where` string (e.g. so a table with just `visit` IDs along with `instrument='LSSTCam'` in the `where` string will work).
